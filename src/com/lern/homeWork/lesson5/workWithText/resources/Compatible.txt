Once upon a time an old man went for a walk along a river. It was a very hot day, and he was thirsty. He bent down and drank some water. 
The water was clean and sweet, but a bit strange. Just then he saw a face in the water. Whose face was that? He knew this face! 
It was his face, but he looked very young! I have found the fountain of youth! The man ran home to tell his wife the news.
I must drink that water, too, said the woman. I want to be young! Her husband told her how to find the magic water, and the woman went off.
When she found the river, she took a long drink of cool water. Then she took another. And another. With each drink she became younger and younger.
Her husband waited and waited for his wife to come back. After a few hours he began to worry and went to look for her. 
When he came to the river bank he saw a little baby there. It is very easy to drink too much water from the fountain of youth. 
His wife had drunk so much water that she had become a baby again.
